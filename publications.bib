    abstract  ="We show that the application of lateral shear force on a randomly oriented thin film of carbon nanotubes{,} in the dry state{,} causes significant reordering of the nanotubes at the film surface. This new technique of dry shear aligning is applicable to carbon nanotube thin films produced by many of the established methods."
